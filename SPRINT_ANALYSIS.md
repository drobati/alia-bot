## Critical Issues Analysis

### üö® Security Vulnerabilities (IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED)

#### Issue #179: /reload Command Security Vulnerability
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: Anyone can reload bot commands, potentially causing service disruption  
**Current State**: `/reload` command has NO owner protection checks

```typescript
// CURRENT VULNERABLE CODE:
async execute(interaction: any, { log }: any) {
    const commandName = interaction.options.getString('command', true).toLowerCase();
    // ‚ùå NO PERMISSION CHECK - SECURITY VULNERABILITY
    await reloadCommand(interaction.client, commandName, log);
}
```

**Required Fix**: Add `checkOwnerPermission()` call like `/speak` command  
**Sprint Priority**: P0 - Must fix in Sprint 1 Day 1  
**Effort Estimate**: 0.5 days
